**TODO:**

* general:
    * Improve the README file
    * Improve coverage of automated tests
    * Add queue_errors error handler. Use for an example to send flash_messages for Flask support. Add option to 
        validators to force running all validators vs. quiting after first error found.

* get_input:
    * send error messages to stderr?
    * replace raw_input with version using sys.stdin.readline()
    * show all errors for validation errors? Perform like flash messages where can have a list of them?
    * provide kwarg to run all validators, instead of failing on first one, so can see all errors.
    * add routine to make menus more easily

* get_table_input
    * make it easier to make tables from query results
    * allow showing multiple columns tables (with one column as value)
    * allow value column to show longer description, but type in value
    * allow typing unique first characters of a choice input?
    * add render_table method to allow printing other than prettytable

* tutorial:
    * Add tables (build-a-burger) to tutorial
    * add part 2 (and part 3?) to tutorial to show more examples: passwords (get_user_info), tables,
        menus, and databases?
    * move `more examples` to `how-to` in a separate file?
           
* examples/tests:
    * add: date
    * example runner (install as an entry point script.) Use get_input for menus.
    * add coverage to tests

* cleaners:
    * add EncodingCleaner to encode the value (see str.encode)
    * cleaner for Unicode normalization and character encodings
    * cleaner for html quoting/unquoting
    * strip sql injection when dealing with tables
    * For consistency with wtform, should 'cleaners' be changed to 'filters'?

* convertors:
    * List convertor, how to do choice cleaning? i.e. enter a list with the first letters of the
    list item. Have cleaners for list elements?
    * Dollar convertor that has minimum of 0.00 and strips off $ sign and commas. Returns float
    * Boolean convertor, add 'false_values' list ('true_values' too?)
    * Time convertor
    * Float convertor - add places, rounding and locale parameters/options
    * add: File convertor - pattern for name, suffix, path, check for existence, wildcard for multiple fields
 
* validators:
    * add: date range, date day of week
    * allow forcing to validate all validators instead of stopping on first failure
    * return list of all validation failures
    * provide list of hints for what is required
    * password validator should create hint of what's required for password
    * have validators return True or False, with errors in self.errors? This is
    more consistent with wtform but feels less Pythonic.
    * Add a URL validator, with require_tld
    * Add 'DataRequired' validator. This would check that the data coming into the validator
    is not None. Similar to wtform. Change 'required' option to 'input_required'?
    * Add 'OptionalValidator' w/ strip white space parm, sends StopValidation if not present? 
    Wtforms has this to allow a blank validation value.

* v2 and beyond:
    * Can cleaners and convertor be merged to just a list of filters (i.e. a convertor is a 
    filter that changes the type)? Cleaners are always 
    on strings is easy, but could work on other types and chain. Are there filters you 
    want to do on other types (e.g. Scale a number?)
    * Can validators be combined with filters (i.e. a validator is just a filter that fails?)?
    * Need to look at scenarios. It is simpler but it requires keeping track of the type coming 
    out of each filter in the chain.
    * Alternatively, could have pre and post filters - pre-filters run on strings before
    conversion and validation; Post filters on the converted type (would this be before or
    after validation?)
    * option to list choices in prompt_str (???)? Show hints? Create Mini-language of /cmds
    * autocomplete, readline history and color. Required or can be done already(???)
